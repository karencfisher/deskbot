# deskbot version 0.01

Project developing an interactive robot. "Deskbot" for now as it would be on your desk, tracking your movement and able to interact with 
you. It could also be adapted for a variety of use cases.

Currently, it performs:
* Face tracking. It adjust keeping you in the center of the visual field, allowing it to be responsive.
* Speech recognition.

### neurotic_robot_py

"Neurotic" in the sense that it just follows your movements and repeats anything you say. It also gets upset if it can't see you anymore 
until you come back. :) It's just testing the face tracking and sppech recognition components.
